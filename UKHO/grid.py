"""
This is going to be a monster.

Grid the data in the whole UKHO data set received so far (2015/04/07) to 1km
resolution. That's pretty low compared with the source data (probably), but is
pretty high for a shelf-wide data set. To make this even vaguely managable,
split the entire domain up into 100km by 100km tiles.

Don't do any fancy gridding (the newest, highest quality etc.) just average
everything which touches each tile.

# Script to read Katsuto's boundary data files and produce MIKE21
# Tide Prediction of Heights files. These produce dfs0 files which 
# need to be merged into individual dfs1 files.
#
# If passing files as an argument, the wildcard should be the tidal
# constituent, not the time before present:
#
# prompt$ ./mk_mike21.sh ./fixed/bta0-m2-??ka_m.dat
#
# Pierre Cazenave pwc101@soton.ac.uk

# 24/05/2010 - first go.
# 25/05/2010 - added support for passing the files to the command 
#					line.
# 20/07/2010 - added checks for coordinates to extract data which 
#					aren't on land (i.e. clip the inputs).
#				- also changed input directory to ./fixed, rather 
#					than ./formatted, the latter being in cm and not
#					metres.
#				- moved output destination for the dfs0 files to the
#					parent directory because the .21t files now live 
#					in their own subdirectory.
#				- output the clipped coordinates to MIKE21 friendly 
#					.xyz files to check that the clipping has worked.
#				- fixed a bug in the lon/lat assignments in the output 
#					files. Previously, the fields weren't being populated 
#					with the updated values.
#				- changed template file to not use numbers as placeholders,
#					instead, it uses all caps strings.
# 04/10/2010 - amended the land clipping to use variable positions as
#				a function of the time before present. The lookup table
#				is defined based on the positions from Peltier's ICE-5G
#				zero contour, plus a little wiggle room.
# 13/10/2010 - added more land clipping values, and fixed the value of 
#				timeSinceLand so that it actually works now.
#				- also added set -eu so that if there's a problem, the 
#					script bombs out, rather than ploughing on regardless.
#				
# TODO:
#		 - need to be able to use the southernmost value from the western
#		 boundary as the westernmost value on the southern boundary so that
#		 they share a common point. Not sure about how to achieve this...
#
# NOTE: Best off running this on sarge - Windows 7 seems to enjoy using
# upwards of 12GB of RAM running this through Cygwin and PuTTYcyg. I'm 
# assuming this is a Cygwin bug rather than Windows, though the rogue 
# process is dwm.exe (the window manager...). Also, it runs a lot faster
# on native Linux than through Cygwin.

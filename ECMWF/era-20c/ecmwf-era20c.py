"""
Get the relevant forcing data from the ECMWF servers.

This is split into analysis:
    - 2m temperature
    - 10m u wind
    - 10m v wind
    - Surface pressure
and forecast:
    - Evaporation
    - Total precipitation
    - Surface net solar (long wave)
    - Surface net thermal (short wave)
    - Surface downward solar (long wave)
    - Surface downward thermal (short wave)

The relative humidity is calculated from the dew point temperature and ambient
temperature.

The forecast data are accumulated from 0600UTC with each forecast step (3 hour
interval). The 3rd time step is therefore the accumulated data from 0600
+ 9 hours, which is the value at 1500. To get the instantaneous, subtract the
accumulated from the given step from the previous step's data and then divide
the result by the interval (3 hours):

    inst = (data(n) - data(n - 1)) / interval
